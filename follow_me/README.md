# Semantic Segmentation - Follow Me

---

In this notebook, I built two segmentation networks to track VIP in an image. I used the data set for one of the projects at RoboND, Udacity. However, I have implemented different models. One is the original [SegNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561.pdf) and the other has a similar structure but all the convolutional layers are replaced by depthwise separable convolutional layers. Due to the technical constraint, **I have not combined the pooling indices in the encoder to the decoder!!!** Moreover, I used the default upsampling implemented in Keras which simply repeats the values in the lower layer and differs from bilinear upsampling.
